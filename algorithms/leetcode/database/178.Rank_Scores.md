# 178. Rank Scores

Level: **Medium**

Write a SQL query to rank scores. If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking. Note that after a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no "holes" between ranks.

```
+----+-------+
| Id | Score |
+----+-------+
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |
+----+-------+
```

For example, given the above `Scores` table, your query should generate the following report (order by highest score):

```
+-------+------+
| Score | Rank |
+-------+------+
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 3.85  | 2    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.50  | 4    |
+-------+------+
```

**Solution**

##解法一

```sql
SELECT
    Score,
    (SELECT count(DISTINCT Score)
        FROM Scores
        WHERE Score >= s.Score) Rank
FROM Scores s
ORDER BY Score DESC
```

##解法二

```sql
SELECT
    s.Score,
    COUNT(DISTINCT t.Score) Rank
FROM Scores s
    JOIN Scores t ON s.Score <= t.Score
GROUP BY s.Id
ORDER BY s.Score DESC;
```
