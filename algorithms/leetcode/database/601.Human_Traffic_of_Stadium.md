# 601. Human Traffic of Stadium

Level: **Hard**

X city built a new stadium, each day many people visit it and the stats are saved as these columns: **id**, **date**, **people** <br>

Please write a query to display the records which have 3 or more consecutive rows and the amount of people more than 100(inclusive). <br>

For example, the table `stadium`:<br>

```
+------+------------+-----------+
| id   | date       | people    |
+------+------------+-----------+
| 1    | 2017-01-01 | 10        |
| 2    | 2017-01-02 | 109       |
| 3    | 2017-01-03 | 150       |
| 4    | 2017-01-04 | 99        |
| 5    | 2017-01-05 | 145       |
| 6    | 2017-01-06 | 1455      |
| 7    | 2017-01-07 | 199       |
| 8    | 2017-01-08 | 188       |
+------+------------+-----------+
```

For the sample data above, the output is:

```
+------+------------+-----------+
| id   | date       | people    |
+------+------------+-----------+
| 5    | 2017-01-05 | 145       |
| 6    | 2017-01-06 | 1455      |
| 7    | 2017-01-07 | 199       |
| 8    | 2017-01-08 | 188       |
+------+------------+-----------+
```

**Solution**

```sql
SELECT

  DISTINCT s1.*

FROM stadium s1, stadium s2, stadium s3
WHERE s1.people >= 100 AND s2.people >= 100 AND s3.people >= 100
      AND
      (
        (s1.id - s2.id = 1 AND s1.id - s3.id = 2 AND s2.id - s3.id = 1)
        OR
        (s2.id - s1.id = 1 AND s2.id - s3.id = 2 AND s1.id - s3.id = 1)
        OR
        (s3.id - s2.id = 1 AND s2.id - s1.id = 1 AND s3.id - s1.id = 2)
      )

ORDER BY s1.id
