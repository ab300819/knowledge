# 190. Reverse Bits

Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

**Example:**

```
Input: 43261596
Output: 964176192
Explanation: 43261596 represented in binary as 00000010100101000001111010011100, 
             return 964176192 represented in binary as 00111001011110000010100101000000.

## Solution

### Java

```java
public class Solution {
    // you need treat n as an unsigned value
    public int reverseBits(int n) {
        int result=0;
        for(int i=0;i<32;i++){
            
            result+=n&1;
            n>>>=1;
            
            if(i<31) result<<=1;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```
